# OBJ2100 Exam - 2024Q2

This is the project developed for the 2024Q2 exam in the class Object-Oriented Programming 2100 at the University of South-Eastern Norway.

> :warning: **This is a mixed-language repository.** You may come across usage of Norwegian in places, but primarily the project _should_ be in English.

# Structure

The project is divided into two main parts, with a third shared part:
- The Client: A JavaFX application that communicates with the server.
- The Server: A socket application that serves as the backend for the client.
- The Shared module: A module that contains shared code, that is included with either the client or the server, when it is built.
